This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## TDD Agent 🎯

This repository includes a **TDD (Test-Driven Development) Agent** to help you follow the red/green/refactor cycle.

### Quick Start with TDD

```bash
# Run tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

**Learn more:**
- [TDD Agent Guide](TDD_AGENT_README.md) - How to use the TDD agent
- [TDD Workflow](TDD_WORKFLOW.md) - Complete TDD development guide
- [TDD Example](TDD_EXAMPLE.md) - Live example with email validation

**Try it out:**
The repository includes a live TDD example with failing tests. Try fixing the `validateEmail` function in `lib/utils.ts` to make the tests in `__tests__/lib/utils.test.ts` pass!

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
